# SeeUsoon
This is a static HTML web page. I have used CSS for styling with bootstrap as a framework along with some favicons. 
The page was a proposed >sign in web page for a **tracking** website.
I created this as my first personal project when I initially learned web development.

## Preview of the website
Given below is just a preview of the website and it may lack some of the features of the original website. For complete experience I would recommend you to download the source files and run the files locally on your system.
